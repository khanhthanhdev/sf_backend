# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing video generation workflow to provide a seamless end-to-end experience from API request to video delivery. The current system has most components in place but needs better integration between the FastAPI backend, the video generation pipeline, AWS S3 storage, and the worker processes. The enhancement will ensure that when a video generation request is made, it triggers the complete workflow: job creation → queue processing → video generation → S3 upload → metadata storage → URL serving to frontend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to make a video generation request and receive immediate job tracking information, so that I can provide real-time progress updates to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/v1/videos/generate` THEN the system SHALL create a job in Redis with status "queued"
2. WHEN a job is created THEN the system SHALL return a job_id and initial status within 2 seconds
3. WHEN a job is queued THEN the system SHALL add it to the Redis job queue for worker processing
4. WHEN the job status is requested via `/api/v1/videos/jobs/{job_id}/status` THEN the system SHALL return current progress and stage information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a background worker, I want to automatically process video generation jobs from the queue, so that videos are generated without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job is added to the Redis queue THEN the video worker SHALL pick it up within 10 seconds
2. WHEN a worker starts processing a job THEN the system SHALL update the job status to "processing"
3. WHEN the worker processes a job THEN it SHALL integrate with the main video generation pipeline (main.py functionality)
4. WHEN video generation progresses THEN the worker SHALL update job progress in real-time with stage and percentage information
5. IF video generation fails THEN the worker SHALL update the job status to "failed" with error details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want generated videos to be automatically uploaded to AWS S3 with proper metadata, so that they can be served efficiently to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video generation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL upload the video file to the appropriate S3 bucket
2. WHEN a video is uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL generate and store video metadata including file size, duration, and dimensions
3. WHEN video upload completes THEN the system SHALL create thumbnail images and upload them to S3
4. WHEN S3 upload is successful THEN the system SHALL store the S3 URLs in Redis and database for quick access
5. WHEN video processing is complete THEN the system SHALL update the job status to "completed" with video metadata

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want to retrieve video download and streaming URLs for completed jobs, so that I can display videos to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job is completed THEN the `/api/v1/videos/jobs/{job_id}/download` endpoint SHALL return a streaming response with the video file
2. WHEN a video download is requested THEN the system SHALL support HTTP range requests for efficient streaming
3. WHEN video metadata is requested via `/api/v1/videos/jobs/{job_id}/metadata` THEN the system SHALL return complete video information including S3 URLs
4. WHEN a thumbnail is requested via `/api/v1/videos/jobs/{job_id}/thumbnail` THEN the system SHALL serve the thumbnail image with appropriate caching headers
5. WHEN streaming is requested via `/api/v1/videos/jobs/{job_id}/stream` THEN the system SHALL provide optimized video streaming with quality options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I understand what went wrong if video generation fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video generation fails at any stage THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information including stage and cause
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the job status SHALL be updated to "failed" with error_code and error_message
3. WHEN a failed job is queried THEN the API SHALL return the error details to help with troubleshooting
4. WHEN the system encounters AWS S3 errors THEN it SHALL retry upload operations up to 3 times before marking as failed
5. WHEN Redis connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect and continue processing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging of the video generation workflow, so that I can track performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any workflow stage executes THEN the system SHALL log detailed information including job_id, user_id, and timing
2. WHEN video generation completes THEN the system SHALL record performance metrics including processing time and file sizes
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log stack traces and context information for debugging
4. WHEN jobs are processed THEN the system SHALL track queue length and processing times for monitoring
5. WHEN S3 operations occur THEN the system SHALL log upload progress and success/failure status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the worker process to integrate seamlessly with the existing video generation pipeline, so that all current features continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the worker processes a job THEN it SHALL call the existing main.py video generation functionality
2. WHEN video generation uses RAG or context learning THEN these features SHALL continue to work through the worker
3. WHEN the pipeline generates multiple scenes THEN the worker SHALL handle scene-by-scene progress updates
4. WHEN the existing pipeline creates thumbnails THEN the worker SHALL ensure they are uploaded to S3
5. WHEN video quality settings are specified THEN the worker SHALL pass them correctly to the generation pipeline
