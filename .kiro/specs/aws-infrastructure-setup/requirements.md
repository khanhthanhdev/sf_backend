# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the current video generation application from local file storage and Redis-based data management to a robust AWS cloud infrastructure. The migration will implement AWS S3 for scalable file storage with versioning capabilities and AWS RDS for persistent relational data storage of user information, job metadata, and application state. This infrastructure setup will provide better scalability, reliability, and data persistence for the video generation platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure AWS S3 buckets for file storage, so that videos, code files, and other assets are stored reliably in the cloud with proper versioning and access controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system stores a video file THEN S3 SHALL save the file with automatic versioning enabled
2. WHEN the system stores code files THEN S3 SHALL organize files by user ID and job ID in a hierarchical structure
3. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN S3 SHALL generate secure pre-signed URLs for controlled access
4. WHEN file storage exceeds defined limits THEN S3 SHALL implement lifecycle policies to manage storage costs
5. IF a file upload fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and log the error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure AWS RDS for persistent data storage, so that user information, job metadata, and application state are stored in a reliable relational database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN RDS SHALL be accessible with proper connection pooling configured
2. WHEN user data is created or updated THEN RDS SHALL persist the information with ACID compliance
3. WHEN job status changes THEN RDS SHALL update the job metadata with proper transaction handling
4. WHEN the system queries data THEN RDS SHALL provide consistent read performance with proper indexing
5. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL implement connection retry logic with circuit breaker pattern

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to implement proper AWS IAM roles and policies, so that the application has secure and minimal access to AWS resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application accesses S3 THEN IAM SHALL enforce least-privilege access policies
2. WHEN the application connects to RDS THEN IAM SHALL authenticate using database credentials or IAM database authentication
3. WHEN AWS resources are accessed THEN CloudTrail SHALL log all API calls for audit purposes
4. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN encryption SHALL be enabled at rest and in transit
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN IAM SHALL deny access and log the security event

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update the existing services to integrate with AWS infrastructure, so that the application seamlessly uses cloud storage instead of local storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN FileService uploads a file THEN it SHALL use S3 instead of local storage
2. WHEN VideoService processes videos THEN it SHALL store outputs in S3 with proper metadata
3. WHEN JobService manages job data THEN it SHALL use RDS instead of Redis for persistent storage
4. WHEN UserService handles user data THEN it SHALL store user information in RDS with proper data modeling
5. IF AWS services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation and error handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure environment-specific AWS resources, so that development, staging, and production environments are properly isolated and configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN each SHALL have separate S3 buckets and RDS instances
2. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN they SHALL include all necessary AWS connection parameters
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate AWS connectivity and configuration
4. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN CloudWatch SHALL collect metrics and logs from all AWS resources
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the application SHALL fail fast with clear error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data administrator, I want to migrate existing data from local storage and Redis to AWS, so that no data is lost during the infrastructure transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration starts THEN existing files SHALL be transferred to S3 with preserved metadata
2. WHEN Redis data is migrated THEN it SHALL be properly transformed and stored in RDS tables
3. WHEN migration is in progress THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and integrity
4. WHEN migration completes THEN data validation SHALL confirm successful transfer
5. IF migration fails THEN rollback procedures SHALL restore the previous state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to implement backup and disaster recovery procedures, so that data is protected and can be restored in case of failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RDS is configured THEN automated backups SHALL be enabled with point-in-time recovery
2. WHEN S3 stores files THEN cross-region replication SHALL be configured for critical data
3. WHEN backup procedures run THEN they SHALL be tested regularly for restore capability
4. WHEN disaster recovery is needed THEN documented procedures SHALL enable rapid restoration
5. IF data corruption occurs THEN backup systems SHALL provide multiple recovery points
