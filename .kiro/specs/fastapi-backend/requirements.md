# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a simple FastAPI backend for the multi-agent video generation system. The backend will use Pydantic for all data modeling and validation, Clerk for authentication, and Redis for caching and job queuing. The system will provide RESTful API endpoints to manage video generation requests, monitor processing status, and integrate with the existing multi-agent pipeline through Redis queues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to submit video generation requests through a REST API, so that I can programmatically create educational videos from textual descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/v1/videos/generate` with topic and context data THEN the system SHALL accept the request and return a unique job ID
2. WHEN the request includes optional parameters like model selection, quality settings, or RAG configuration THEN the system SHALL validate and apply these parameters
3. WHEN the request payload is invalid or missing required fields THEN the system SHALL return a 422 validation error with detailed field-level error messages
4. WHEN the system receives a valid request THEN it SHALL queue the job for processing and return a 201 status code with job metadata

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to monitor the status of video generation jobs, so that I can track progress and know when videos are ready for download.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/v1/videos/jobs/{job_id}/status` THEN the system SHALL return the current job status (queued, processing, completed, failed)
2. WHEN a job is in progress THEN the system SHALL return progress information including current stage and percentage completion
3. WHEN a job has failed THEN the system SHALL return error details and failure reason
4. WHEN a job is completed THEN the system SHALL return metadata about the generated video including file size and duration
5. WHEN an invalid job ID is provided THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to retrieve completed videos and their metadata, so that I can download and use the generated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/v1/videos/jobs/{job_id}/download` for a completed job THEN the system SHALL return the video file as a streaming response
2. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/v1/videos/jobs/{job_id}/metadata` THEN the system SHALL return comprehensive job metadata including processing logs and performance metrics
3. WHEN a job is not yet completed THEN the download endpoint SHALL return a 409 conflict error
4. WHEN the video file is not found THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
5. WHEN downloading large files THEN the system SHALL support HTTP range requests for partial content delivery

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage and monitor the video generation pipeline, so that I can ensure optimal system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/v1/system/health` THEN the system SHALL return health status of all components including database, queue, and agent services
2. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/v1/system/metrics` THEN the system SHALL return performance metrics including queue length, processing times, and resource utilization
3. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/v1/system/jobs/{job_id}/cancel` THEN the system SHALL attempt to cancel the job and return cancellation status
4. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/v1/system/jobs` with pagination parameters THEN the system SHALL return a paginated list of all jobs with filtering options
5. WHEN system resources are critically low THEN the health endpoint SHALL return a 503 service unavailable status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to upload custom content and configurations, so that I can customize the video generation process with specific materials or settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/v1/uploads/content` with multipart form data THEN the system SHALL accept and store uploaded files securely
2. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL validate file types, sizes, and scan for malicious content
3. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/v1/configurations` with custom settings THEN the system SHALL validate and store the configuration for later use
4. WHEN uploaded content exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL return a 413 payload too large error
5. WHEN invalid file types are uploaded THEN the system SHALL return a 415 unsupported media type error

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to authenticate requests using Clerk authentication, so that the system remains secure and user access is properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made without a valid Clerk session token THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error
2. WHEN a request is made with an invalid or expired Clerk token THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error
3. WHEN a valid Clerk token is provided THEN the system SHALL extract user information and process the request
4. WHEN user information is needed THEN the system SHALL retrieve it from Clerk's user management system
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return a 429 too many requests error

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want comprehensive API documentation and client generation capabilities, so that I can efficiently build applications that consume the video generation service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing `/docs` THEN the system SHALL provide interactive Swagger UI documentation with all endpoints and schemas
2. WHEN accessing `/redoc` THEN the system SHALL provide ReDoc documentation interface
3. WHEN accessing `/openapi.json` THEN the system SHALL return the complete OpenAPI specification
4. WHEN generating client code THEN the OpenAPI specification SHALL include proper operation IDs and detailed schemas
5. WHEN API changes are made THEN the documentation SHALL automatically update to reflect the current API state

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the API to handle errors gracefully and provide detailed logging, so that I can maintain system reliability and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with consistent error response format
2. WHEN internal errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information without exposing sensitive data to clients
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return specific field-level error messages
4. WHEN the system is under high load THEN it SHALL implement proper backpressure and queue management
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate alerting mechanisms

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to receive real-time updates about job progress, so that I can provide live feedback to users about video generation status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebSocket connection is established to `/ws/jobs/{job_id}` THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates
2. WHEN job status changes THEN connected WebSocket clients SHALL receive immediate notifications
3. WHEN processing stages complete THEN clients SHALL receive detailed progress information
4. WHEN WebSocket connections are lost THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection gracefully
5. WHEN multiple clients connect to the same job THEN all SHALL receive synchronized updates

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the API to support batch operations and bulk processing, so that I can efficiently handle multiple video generation requests simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/v1/videos/batch` with multiple video requests THEN the system SHALL create multiple jobs and return batch job metadata
2. WHEN batch processing is requested THEN the system SHALL optimize resource allocation across multiple jobs
3. WHEN batch jobs are queried THEN the system SHALL return aggregated status information for all jobs in the batch
4. WHEN individual jobs in a batch fail THEN other jobs SHALL continue processing independently
5. WHEN batch size exceeds system limits THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with suggested batch sizes
