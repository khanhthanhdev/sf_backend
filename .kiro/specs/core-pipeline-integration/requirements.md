# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the sophisticated core video generation workflow (from `src/core/`) with the existing FastAPI video endpoints. Currently, the API endpoints use a simplified video processing approach that doesn't leverage the full capabilities of the core agents pipeline including EnhancedVideoPlanner, CodeGenerator, OptimizedVideoRenderer, and VideoGenerationOrchestrator.

The integration will enable API requests to trigger the complete pipeline: planning → scenario creation → Manim code generation → rendering → storage, while maintaining the existing API contract and adding enhanced progress tracking, error handling, and storage management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to submit video generation requests that utilize the full core agents pipeline, so that I can generate high-quality videos with sophisticated planning and rendering capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/videos/generate` THEN the system SHALL trigger the complete core pipeline workflow
2. WHEN the core pipeline is initiated THEN the system SHALL use EnhancedVideoPlanner for scene outline creation
3. WHEN scene planning is complete THEN the system SHALL use CodeGenerator for Manim code generation with RAG support
4. WHEN code generation is complete THEN the system SHALL use OptimizedVideoRenderer for video rendering
5. WHEN all scenes are rendered THEN the system SHALL combine videos using the video combination functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to receive real-time progress updates during video generation, so that I can track the status of long-running video creation processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video generation starts THEN the system SHALL update job progress to "initializing" with 5% completion
2. WHEN scene planning begins THEN the system SHALL update progress to "planning" with 15% completion
3. WHEN scenario creation starts THEN the system SHALL update progress to "scenario_creation" with 30% completion
4. WHEN code generation begins THEN the system SHALL update progress to "code_generation" with 50% completion
5. WHEN rendering starts THEN the system SHALL update progress to "rendering" with 80% completion
6. WHEN video combination begins THEN the system SHALL update progress to "combining" with 90% completion
7. WHEN storage upload starts THEN the system SHALL update progress to "storage" with 95% completion
8. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL update progress to "completed" with 100% completion
9. WHEN progress updates occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed stage descriptions and timestamps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API client, I want the existing API contract to remain unchanged, so that my current integrations continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making requests to existing endpoints THEN the system SHALL maintain the same request/response formats
2. WHEN accessing `/videos/jobs/{job_id}/status` THEN the system SHALL return job status in the existing format
3. WHEN accessing `/videos/jobs/{job_id}/video-url` THEN the system SHALL return video URLs in the existing format
4. WHEN accessing `/videos/jobs/{job_id}/stream` THEN the system SHALL stream video content as before
5. WHEN accessing `/videos/jobs/{job_id}/download` THEN the system SHALL provide download functionality as before
6. IF new fields are added to responses THEN the system SHALL ensure backward compatibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms, so that video generation failures are handled gracefully with proper reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during planning THEN the system SHALL capture the error with stage context and mark job as failed
2. WHEN an error occurs during code generation THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery if the error is recoverable
3. WHEN an error occurs during rendering THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggest recovery actions
4. WHEN a recoverable error occurs THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN maximum retries are reached THEN the system SHALL mark the job as permanently failed with detailed error logs
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL update job status with error stage and descriptive messages
7. IF storage upload fails THEN the system SHALL retry upload operations up to 3 times before marking as failed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want integrated storage management with both local and S3 support, so that generated videos are properly stored and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video generation completes THEN the system SHALL store videos using the configured StorageManager
2. WHEN S3 storage is enabled THEN the system SHALL upload videos to S3 and update job records with S3 URLs
3. WHEN local storage is configured THEN the system SHALL store videos locally and provide local file paths
4. WHEN storage mode is "local_and_s3" THEN the system SHALL store videos both locally and in S3
5. WHEN thumbnails are enabled THEN the system SHALL generate and store video thumbnails
6. WHEN storage operations complete THEN the system SHALL update job records with final video URLs and metadata
7. IF cleanup is enabled THEN the system SHALL remove temporary local files after successful S3 upload

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable pipeline settings through environment variables, so that I can customize model selection, quality settings, and performance parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read model configuration from environment variables (PLANNER_MODEL, SCENE_MODEL, HELPER_MODEL)
2. WHEN RAG is enabled via USE_RAG environment variable THEN the system SHALL initialize RAG capabilities for code generation
3. WHEN MAX_SCENE_CONCURRENCY is set THEN the system SHALL limit concurrent scene processing to the specified value
4. WHEN MAX_CONCURRENT_RENDERS is set THEN the system SHALL limit concurrent rendering operations
5. WHEN DEFAULT_QUALITY is specified THEN the system SHALL use that quality setting for video rendering
6. WHEN USE_GPU_ACCELERATION is enabled THEN the system SHALL utilize GPU acceleration for rendering
7. IF environment variables are not set THEN the system SHALL use sensible default values

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want performance monitoring and resource management, so that I can ensure optimal system performance and prevent resource exhaustion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN concurrent jobs are running THEN the system SHALL enforce concurrency limits to prevent resource exhaustion
2. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement caching strategies to optimize performance
3. WHEN rendering operations are active THEN the system SHALL monitor and report performance metrics
4. WHEN storage operations occur THEN the system SHALL track upload/download performance and success rates
5. WHEN jobs are queued THEN the system SHALL provide queue depth and processing time estimates
6. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle backpressure and queue management

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an API client, I want detailed logging and debugging information, so that I can troubleshoot issues and understand system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video generation starts THEN the system SHALL log job initialization with user context and parameters
2. WHEN each pipeline stage begins THEN the system SHALL log stage entry with timing information
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error context including stack traces and recovery attempts
4. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and bottleneck information
5. WHEN storage operations occur THEN the system SHALL log upload/download progress and completion status
6. IF debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging for all pipeline operations
7. WHEN jobs complete THEN the system SHALL log completion status with total processing time and resource usage
