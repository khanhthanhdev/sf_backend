# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for refactoring the existing FastAPI backend to follow industry best practices, SOLID principles, and enterprise-grade documentation standards suitable for large development teams. The current codebase shows good structure but needs systematic improvements in architecture, documentation, testing, and maintainability to support scalable team development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want the codebase to follow SOLID principles, so that the code is maintainable, testable, and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining service classes THEN each class SHALL have a single responsibility and clear purpose
2. WHEN adding new functionality THEN existing code SHALL be open for extension but closed for modification
3. WHEN implementing interfaces THEN concrete implementations SHALL depend on abstractions, not concretions
4. WHEN creating service dependencies THEN they SHALL be injected through constructor parameters or dependency injection
5. WHEN refactoring existing services THEN interface segregation SHALL be applied to avoid fat interfaces

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want comprehensive API documentation with examples and schemas, so that developers can understand and integrate with the API efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing API documentation THEN each endpoint SHALL have detailed descriptions, parameter explanations, and response schemas
2. WHEN viewing endpoint documentation THEN realistic request and response examples SHALL be provided
3. WHEN examining data models THEN all Pydantic schemas SHALL have field descriptions and validation rules documented
4. WHEN integrating with the API THEN error responses SHALL be documented with clear error codes and messages
5. WHEN using authentication endpoints THEN security requirements and token formats SHALL be clearly documented

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, so that I can work on specific features without affecting unrelated code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN business logic SHALL be separated from API routing and data access layers
2. WHEN implementing new features THEN domain models SHALL be independent of external frameworks
3. WHEN accessing data THEN repository pattern SHALL be used to abstract database operations
4. WHEN handling business operations THEN service layer SHALL contain business logic separate from API controllers
5. WHEN managing cross-cutting concerns THEN middleware SHALL handle authentication, logging, and error handling consistently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage with unit, integration, and API tests, so that code changes can be validated automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN unit tests SHALL cover all service layer business logic with at least 80% coverage
2. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN integration tests SHALL validate request/response flows and error handling
3. WHEN testing database operations THEN repository tests SHALL use test databases or mocking
4. WHEN running the test suite THEN all tests SHALL be isolated and repeatable
5. WHEN adding new features THEN corresponding tests SHALL be written following test-driven development practices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want standardized configuration management and environment handling, so that the application can be deployed consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN configuration SHALL be managed through environment variables and settings classes
2. WHEN starting the application THEN environment-specific settings SHALL be validated at startup
3. WHEN handling secrets THEN sensitive configuration SHALL be properly secured and not logged
4. WHEN configuring services THEN dependency injection SHALL be used for service configuration
5. WHEN managing database connections THEN connection pooling and health checks SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want robust error handling and security practices, so that the application is resilient and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN logging errors THEN sensitive information SHALL NOT be exposed in logs or error responses
3. WHEN validating input THEN all user input SHALL be validated using Pydantic schemas
4. WHEN handling authentication THEN security headers and CORS policies SHALL be properly configured
5. WHEN processing requests THEN rate limiting and request size validation SHALL be enforced

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code style and documentation standards, so that the codebase is readable and maintainable by all team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining code THEN consistent naming conventions and code formatting SHALL be applied
2. WHEN reading functions and classes THEN comprehensive docstrings SHALL explain purpose, parameters, and return values
3. WHEN reviewing code THEN type hints SHALL be used throughout the codebase
4. WHEN adding new modules THEN README files SHALL document module purpose and usage
5. WHEN implementing features THEN code comments SHALL explain complex business logic and design decisions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want optimized database operations and caching strategies, so that the application performs well under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing database queries THEN connection pooling SHALL be used efficiently
2. WHEN accessing frequently used data THEN appropriate caching strategies SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN async/await patterns SHALL be used consistently
4. WHEN processing large datasets THEN pagination SHALL be implemented for list endpoints
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN database query performance SHALL be logged and monitored

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application events occur THEN structured logging SHALL provide detailed context and correlation IDs
2. WHEN errors happen THEN error details SHALL be logged with appropriate severity levels
3. WHEN monitoring system health THEN health check endpoints SHALL validate all critical dependencies
4. WHEN tracking user actions THEN audit logs SHALL record important business operations
5. WHEN analyzing performance THEN request/response times and resource usage SHALL be logged

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear dependency management and service lifecycle handling, so that services are properly initialized and cleaned up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN all services SHALL be initialized in the correct order with proper error handling
2. WHEN shutting down THEN resources SHALL be cleaned up gracefully to prevent data loss
3. WHEN managing dependencies THEN circular dependencies SHALL be avoided through proper architecture
4. WHEN configuring services THEN factory patterns SHALL be used for complex service creation
5. WHEN handling service failures THEN graceful degradation SHALL be implemented where possible
