        "description": "manim-Chemistry is a Manim plugin specifically designed for creating chemistry-related animations. Unlike plugins that rely on external chemistry packages, manim-Chemistry primarily uses Manim's built-in tools in conjunction with .mol files and .csv databases. It focuses on visualizing fundamental chemistry concepts like the Periodic Table, 2D/3D molecular structures, and chemical reactions from scratch.  It intentionally avoids dependencies on external libraries like Mendeleev, RDKit, PyMOL, or Open Babel to minimize maintenance, though users can integrate them if desired."

        "description": "ManimML is a Manim plugin dedicated to visualizing machine learning concepts. It offers a collection of pre-built animations for fundamental ML components and provides abstractions to simplify the creation of complex machine learning visualizations. Use this plugin to explain topics like neural networks, gradient descent, clustering, and other core machine learning algorithms. It focuses on providing building blocks rather than full, pre-made explanations."
